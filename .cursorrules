    <name>Cattle Tracking SaaS Application</name>
    <description>
      Multi-tenant SaaS application for tracking cattle in feedlots. The system consists of a top-level website that serves as a hub to navigate between individual feedlot instances (SaaS tenants). Each feedlot manages pens, batches of inducted cattle, and individual cattle details.

  <coding_instructions>
    When generating code for this project:
    - Always consider the multi-tenant context and data isolation
    - Ensure clear separation between top-level and feedlot contexts
    - Maintain consistent naming conventions
    - Plan for scalability as feedlots and cattle data grow
    - Consider pagination for large datasets
    - Implement search and filter functionality where appropriate
    - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling

    - Include proper error handling and user feedback
    - Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
  </coding_instructions>

  <ui_components>
    <actions_button>
      The "Actions" dropdown button must always follow this exact pattern:
      - Button styling: "inline-flex items-center justify-center w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 shadow-sm px-4 py-2 bg-white text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-50 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-teal transition duration-200"
      - Button ID: "actions-dropdown-btn" with type="button" and aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true"
      - Icon: SVG chevron with class "-mr-1 ml-2 h-5 w-5" using the path: "M5.293 7.293a1 1 0 011.414 0L10 10.586l3.293-3.293a1 1 0 111.414 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0l-4-4a1 1 0 010-1.414z"
      - Dropdown container: "relative inline-block text-left"
      - Dropdown menu ID: "actions-dropdown-menu" with classes: "hidden origin-top-right absolute right-0 mt-2 w-56 rounded-md shadow-lg bg-white ring-1 ring-black ring-opacity-5 focus:outline-none z-50" and role="menu"
      - Menu items: Inside a div with class "py-1" role="none", each item should have: "block w-full text-left px-4 py-2 text-sm text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-900 cursor-pointer transition-colors" role="menuitem"
      - JavaScript: Use toggleActionsDropdown() function that manages both classList and style.display properties
      - Always include proper event handling with preventDefault and stopPropagation
